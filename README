msgthr - non-recursive, container-agnostic message threading
------------------------------------------------------------

Message threading based on the algorithm described by JWZ in
<https://www.jwz.org/doc/threading.html> and used in
countless mail and news readers; but with some features
removed and improved flexibility:

* No pruning of non-leaf ghosts.  Readers are not shielded
  from deleted or lost messages.  Equivalent to setting
  "hide_missing" to "no" in mutt.

* No grouping by subject.  This makes things ideal for short
  messages such as chat and status updates.  For email, this
  encourages the use of proper client which set In-Reply-To
  or References headers.  Equivalent to setting
  "strict_threads" to "yes" in mutt.

* No recursion; all algorithms are non-recursive to avoid
  SystemStackError exceptions in deep threads.
  Memory usage is bound by the number of lightweight containers
  needed to represent a thread.

* Message format-agnostic, not limited to email or NNTP;
  but even appropriate for forums, blog comments, IM, etc.
  For mail and NNTP messages, that means you must extract
  the Message-ID and parse the References and In-Reply-To
  headers into an array yourself.

because HTML/CSS/JS/images are too complicated for us.
